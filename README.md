#Introduction
This was an assignment from my Advanced Robotics course which is one of the highest level course offered by the Robotics department in RIT but can be treated essentially as a small project. It was one of the most difficult assignments that I ever done in my entire career. Hence I am uploading my code. The problem statement is upoloaded as a separate document.
