#Workspace-of-an-Arm-robot
Created by Suvam Bag in the Multi-Agent-Bio-Robotics Laboratory in Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT)

#Introduction
This was an assignment from my Advanced Robotics course which is one of the highest level course offered by the Robotics department in RIT but can be treated essentially as a small project. It was one of the most difficult assignments that I ever done in my entire career. Hence I am uploading my code. The problem statement is upoloaded as a separate document.
  ------- The program was created in Matlab 2012b--------
  
#Description
Usage of forward and backward kinematics to calculate the workspace of a 2-degree arm robot around obstacles in its path.
The report has been uploaded as a separate document.
